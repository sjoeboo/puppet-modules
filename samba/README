A Simple Module to manage Samba the way I like it!

We (work) generally have a bunch of Samba servers, each bound to out domain exactly the same way, and each hosting a handful (mostly 1, some up to 5) samba shares. We keep it simple.

This module uses 2 templates:

1 for the smb.conf: smb.conf.erb
1 for each share config (included from smb.conf) smb_share.conf.erb

Compatability: Tested on CentOS 5/6. Should work on RHEL 5/6. Ubuntu/Debian will require some changes for pacakges/services.
Usage:

Edit the smb.conf.erb template for your environment.

Use on a node:

node 'something.com' {
	include samba
        samba::config { 'something.com':
                includeconf => ['share1','share2'],
        }
        samba::share { 'share1':
                name => 'share1',
                path => '/share1',
        }
        samba::share { 'share2':
                name => "share2",
                path => "/share2"
        }
}
